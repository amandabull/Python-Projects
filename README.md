# Python-Projects
These are some small projects I made using Python.

**Phonebook**

This project functions as a phonebook for a user. It saves a contact's name, phone number and email address in a database and allows the user to update and delete previously stored entries.
    
**Checkbook**

This project functions as a checkbook for user. It allows the user to make deposits and withdrawls, keep a record of all of their transactions and check their current balance.
