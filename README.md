These are some small projects I made using Python.

**Projects**

**Tic-Tac-Toe**

This project is the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. Features include the ability to play with either a friend or against the computer. Users may also enter their name and opt to play again when the game is complete.

**Phonebook**

This project functions as a phonebook for a user. It saves a contact's name, phone number and email address in a database and allows the user to update and delete previously stored entries.
    
**Checkbook**

This project functions as a checkbook for user. It allows the user to make deposits and withdrawls, keep a record of all of their transactions and check their current balance.

**Live Project**

This project was created for The Tech Academy Python Developer bootcamp's live project. We were tasked with creating a website that allows for various applications. Within my application, users have the ability to add, edit, delete and view entries within a database for Educational Technology.
