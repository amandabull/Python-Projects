**Tic-Tac-Toe**

This project is the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. Features include the ability to play with either a friend or against the computer. Users may also enter their name and opt to play again when the game is complete.

**Phonebook**

This project functions as a phonebook for a user. It saves a contact's name, phone number and email address in a database and allows the user to update and delete previously stored entries.
    
**Checkbook**

This project functions as a checkbook for user. It allows the user to make deposits and withdrawls, keep a record of all of their transactions and check their current balance.
